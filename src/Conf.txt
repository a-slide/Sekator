#    SAMPLE DEFINITIONS       #
###############################

# It is possible to include as many independant sample as required by duplicating a entire sample section and incrementing the id number in the sample section name
# Each sample section is organize as follow :
# name = Unique identifier that will be used to prefix the read files (STRING)
# R1_path = Valid path to the fastq file (gziped or not) containing the forward reads of the pair (preferably absolute path without spaces) (STRING)
# R1_path = Valid path to the fastq file (gziped or not) containing the reverse reads of the pair (preferably absolute path without spaces) (STRING)
# adapter_list = list of adapter DNA sequence to be trimmed if adapter_trimming is required. Separate each adapter by a blank space (LIST OF STR)
